# Cngularities

In this repository I recreate simplified versions of curiosities and mistakes I encounter while programming in C.

### Structure

Each recreation is located in its own directory. If it is a mistake recreation, two versions will be provided, the 'incorrect' or 'unintended' one, and one possible 'correct' or 'intended' solution.

Suggested compilation and execution instructions are provided as well.

### Objective

Helping other C programmers, or programmers in general, that encounter similar situations, and improving my programming skills by isolating these cases from their original codebases to have a better understanding of the situation and then come up with simplified versions and solutions to illustrate others.
